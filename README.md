# Complete theoretical expression of the 6-pulse DQC intramolecular signal
#### (The expression includes pseudosecular dipolar coupling interactions and finite pulse effects)

## File description:
### Code:
- dqc_kernel.py (Python script containing the DQC signal expression)
- dqc_simulations.py (Python script to run strong and weak-pulse DQC simulations)
### Experimental_Data:
